    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I love the savoury, rich taste of beef in black bean sauce, Although it takes a little bit more effort to make than other stir fry recipes (especially when you're making your own black bean sauce), it's actually very simple.

        The sauce can be made ahead, or you can make it as part of this recipe (apart from the hour needed to soak the beans, the rest of the sauce comes together in minutes).
